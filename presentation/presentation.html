        <p>The biggest win was easily finishing the website. I got a great mark and it was a good experience to test our skills. <br> Using the bootstrap was fun to play with. It can really make or break a website.</p>
        <p>The Spice Bowl was easily the hardest assignment because the instructions in our textbooks were really hard to follow.<br>   The instructions were difficult to actually read and there were more than 23 steps.</p>
        <p>I didn't expect the design aspect as much as I expected the programming aspect. I thought that the programming was a lot<br>   harder than it actually was. I especially didn't expect the rainbow poop emoji. (See attatched link)</p>
        <p>I'm not entirely sure where designing websites stands in the modern internet. With the rise of quick and easy website  <br>builders it's really fast and easy to make a quality webisite, although knowing HTML is still very useful to know. </p>
