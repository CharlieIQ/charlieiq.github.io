                <h1>What is Rate My Drive</h1>
                Rate my drive is an app where users can submit reviews for the route, instead of the destinations. These reviews can include traffic, road and weather conditions. This is really useful for tourists and people driving to unknown locations, where they may not know the road. <br>
                <br>McLaughlin’s project was featured at the virtual ‘Canada-Wide Science Fair’ 2021.

                This story is coming soon. I did the interview and sent the images to the eastlink representative to be made into a story. I will post the story when it comes out. It should be out within the next couple weeks I'm hoping.
