            My future plans would be to develop and publish the app and generate revenue. I 
            would try to perfect the review system and make it more visually appealing. I would also 
            try to make it so users can input their own routes, The main highlight was the review 
            system and how user friendly it was. The main shortcoming was the routing system 
            because there was only one route.
